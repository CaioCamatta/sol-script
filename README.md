# Delta-lang

Delta is a stack-based, prototype-based, interpreted, GC-ed programming language.

Developed in C17.

## Language Design

### 1. Scanner

The scanner is a regular language that turns characters into tokens. For example, the "val" becomes "TOKEN_VAL".

The following is Delta's lexical grammar. It's insipired by [Lox's lexical grammar](https://craftinginterpreters.com/appendix-i.html), the [C lexical grammar](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-language/lexical-grammar?view=msvc-170) , and [Scala's lexical syntax](https://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/2.12/01-lexical-syntax.html#identifiers).

```
token:
	keyword
	identifier
	number-literal
	string-literal
	punctuator

keyword:
	"number" 
    "if" 
    "else" 
    "struct" 
    "return" 
    "false" 
    "true" 
    "null"
    "val"
    "prototype"

number-literal:
	digit+ (. digit+)?

string-literal:
	" s-char-sequence* "

s-char-sequence:
	[^\"]

identifier: 
	non-digit (non-digit | digit)*

non-digit: one of
	窶ダ a b c d e f g h i j k l m
	窶ハ o p q r s t u v w x y z
	窶ア B C D E F G H I J K L M
	窶ク O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z

digit: one of
	0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

punctuator: one of
	( ) { } . * + - ! % < > = <= >= == != || && ; ,
```
